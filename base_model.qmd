# Basic risk-sharing model

I first review the canonical risk-sharing, which does not have any "friction" which will be introduced in the literature to explain the data more accurately.
The main implication of the model is that, given an aggregate resource, a household's consumption does not depend on its income shock.
In other words, households' consumption only depends on aggregate shocks, not idiosyncratic shocks.
For this, the model is called "perfect risk-sharing model" or "full risk-sharing model".
In this part, the model is developed and this implication is derived, and I demonstrate how the model implication has been used in empirical studies in the literature.
