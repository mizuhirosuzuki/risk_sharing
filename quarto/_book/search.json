    "text": "4.1 Model in Coate and Ravallion (1993)\nTheir framework is based on an infinite-period repeated game: in each period, players either follow a transfer schedule or renege and will stay in autarky forever. Under symmetric income distribution, they compare first-best transfers under full risk-sharing and best implementable transfers (best in the sense that the transfers that maximize the expected utilities).\nThe problem considered in the paper is to maximize the average expected utility of a household (by symmetry, a transfer schedule that maximizes the average expected utility of one household maximizes that of the other household), subject to the following implementability constraints:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  u(y_i) - u(y_i - \\theta_{ij}) &\\le (v^A(\\Theta) - \\overline{v}) / r \\quad \\text{for all } (i, j) \\\\\n  u(y_j) - u(y_j + \\theta_{ij}) &\\le (v^B(\\Theta) - \\overline{v}) / r \\quad \\text{for all } (i, j),\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is income, \\(\\theta_{ij}\\) is the transfer from A to B when the state is \\((i, j)\\), \\(\\Theta\\) is the entire transfer schedule, or informal insurance arrangement, \\(\\overline{v}\\) is the value under autarky, and \\(r\\) is the discount rate. Per-period expected utilities of A and B, \\(v^A(\\Theta)\\) and \\(v^B(\\Theta)\\), under the informal insurance arrangement \\(\\Theta\\) are\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  v^A(\\Theta) = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} \\pi_{ij} u(y_i - \\theta_{ij}), \\\\\n  v^B(\\Theta) = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} \\pi_{ij} u(y_j + \\theta_{ij}),\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi_{ij}\\) is a probability of the state \\((i, j)\\).\nTo characterize the transfers under those constraints, the authors define the function \\(f(y, w)\\) which implicitly satisfies \\(u(y) - u(y - f) = w\\). The function represents the maximal amount of income that can be taken from a household without violating the implementability constraints where the cost of defection is \\(w\\). With this, they derive that\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n  \\theta_{ij}^* = \\min \\{\\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, f(y_i, (v(\\theta^*) - \\overline{v}) / r) \\}.\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nHere, \\(\\theta^*\\) is the contract which results in the highest average expected utility subject to the implementability constraints, and \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is the transfer schedule under the full risk-sharing. Intuitively, this means that, as long as the implementability constraints are not violated, the transfer schedule coincides with the one under full risk-sharing, but otherwise, as much money as possible is transferred so that the constraints are not violated.\nFurthermore, they examine (i) how the best implementable (ie. under the implementability constraints) insurance arrangement and the full risk-sharing insurance arrangement differ, and (ii) how the best implementable insurance arrangement changes with exogenous variables of the model (discount rate and correlation in income realizations). To (i), they find, for example, that the transfers under the implementability constraints do depend on not the level of incomes, unlike the first-best contracts where transfers depend only on the income difference between households. Regarding the comparative static properties as in the question (ii), they demonstrate smaller transfers among less patient househodls and also in situations where income realizations are highly correlated.\n\n\n\n\nCoate, Stephen, and Martin Ravallion. 1993. “Reciprocity Without Commitment: Characterization and Performance of Informal Insurance Arrangements.” Journal of Development Economics 40 (1): 1–24.\n\n\nLigon, Ethan, Jonathan P Thomas, and Tim Worrall. 2002. “Informal Insurance Arrangements with Limited Commitment: Theory and Evidence from Village Economies.” The Review of Economic Studies 69 (1): 209–44."

    "text": "4.2 Numerical exercise\nI conduct a numerical exercise to replicate Table 3 in Coate and Ravallion (1993).\n\n4.2.1 Procedure\nI follow the parametric settings in Coate and Ravallion (1993). A constant relative risk aversion utility function is assumed: \\(u_y = y^{(1 - \\rho)} / (1 - \\rho)\\). Using the representation of the transfer schedule under the constraints, the authors derive the transfer schedule in the following iterative method:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n  \\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{\\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, f(y_i, (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\overline{v}) / r) \\},\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta^*(t)\\) is the vector of transfers obtained at the \\(t\\)th iteration with \\(\\theta^*(0) = 0\\). The converged vector of \\(\\theta^*(t)\\) is used as the implementable transfers.\nThere is one very minor typo in the paper: the equation (5) should be \\(\\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{ \\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, y_i - [y_i^{1 - \\rho} - (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\bar{v}) (1 - \\rho) / r ]^{1 / (1 - \\rho)} \\}\\) instead of \\(\\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{ \\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, y_i - [y_i^{1 - \\rho} - (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\bar{v}) / r ]^{1 / (1 - \\rho)} \\}\\).

A constant relative risk aversion utility function is assumed: \\(u_y = y^{(1 - \\rho)} / (1 - \\rho)\\). Using the representation of the transfer schedule under the constraints, the authors derive the transfer schedule in the following iterative method:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n  \\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{\\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, f(y_i, (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\overline{v}) / r) \\},\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta^*(t)\\) is the vector of transfers obtained at the \\(t\\)th iteration with \\(\\theta^*(0) = 0\\). The converged vector of \\(\\theta^*(t)\\) is used as the implementable transfers.\nThere is one very minor typo in the paper: the equation (5) should be \\(\\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{ \\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, y_i - [y_i^{1 - \\rho} - (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\bar{v}) (1 - \\rho) / r ]^{1 / (1 - \\rho)} \\}\\) instead of \\(\\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{ \\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, y_i - [y_i^{1 - \\rho} - (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\bar{v}) / r ]^{1 / (1 - \\rho)} \\}\\).

    "text": "In the theoretical part of this paper, Cochrane (1991) allows heterogeneous risk and time preferences across households. However, in his “cross-sectional” analysis, if the economic shocks are independent of these variables, this heterogeneity does not matter for the test of full risk-sharing. Also, Townsend (1994) conducts a time-series analysis for each household in ICRISAT data, which allows different preferences for different households. One problem in this analysis is the temporal length of the data: there are only 10 years of data, which seems too short to conduct a time-series analysis. Here I will introduce works explicitly focusing on the heterogeneouos preferences of households in the context of risk sharing.\n\n3.0.1 Kurosaki (2001)\nTo investigate how risk and time preferences affect the test of full risk-sharing as in Townsend (1994), he considers a model with a household-specific time discount factor (\\(\\rho_i\\)) and utility function in which risk preferences can differ (\\(u_i(c_{ist})\\)). Assuming an interior solution, as in Townsend (1994), the Pareto optimal allocation requires\n\\[\n  \\lambda_i \\rho_i^t u_i'(c_{ist}) = \\mu_{st} \\quad \\forall (s,t),\n\\] where \\(\\lambda_{i}\\) is a Pareto weight for household \\(i\\) and \\(\\mu_{st}\\) is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the feasibility constraint, devided by the probability that the state \\(s\\) is realized in time \\(t\\). Assuming a CARA preferences with a household-specific coefficient of absolute risk aversion, \\(A_i\\), we can derive an equation that looks similar to the one in a canonical risk-sharing model:\n\\[\n  c_{it} = \\alpha_i \\overline{c}_t + \\beta_i + \\gamma_i t,\n\\] where\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\alpha_i &= \\frac{1}{A_i} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{1}{A_j} \\right]^{-1} \\\\\n  \\beta_i  &= \\frac{1}{A_i} \\left[ \\ln \\lambda_i - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\alpha_j \\ln \\lambda_j \\right]^{-1} \\\\\n  \\gamma_i &= \\frac{1}{A_i} \\left[ \\ln \\rho_i - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\alpha_j \\ln \\rho_j \\right]^{-1},\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of households in the community.\nThis equation implies that\n\n\\(\\alpha_i\\) is smaller for a more risk averse household, and\n\\(\\gamma_i\\) is more negative (ie. consumption decreases over time) for a more myopic household.\n\nNote that, if there is no heterogeneity, \\(\\alpha_i\\) is common for all households and \\(\\gamma_i = 0 \\quad \\forall i\\). A CRRA utility function results in a similar equation, but with log consumption.\nTo test whether (i) full risk sharing is achieved and (ii) there is any heterogeneity in terms of time and risk preferrences, with CARA utility functinos, the author estimate\n\\[\n  \\Delta c_{it} = b_i + a_i \\Delta \\overline{c}_t + \\zeta_i X_{it} + u_{it},\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_{it}\\) is the first-different household income. While this looks similar to the estimation equation in Townsend (1994), this equation is much more flexible due to household-specific intercepts and slopes. Notice that here the effect of household income (\\(\\zeta_i\\)) is household specific as well, which allows the author to see which households are more “vulnerable” in the sense that income and consumption are more correlated. The estimation results suggest that (i) the full risk-sharing is not achieved, and (ii) there is heterogeneity among households in their sensitivity to aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. The author also investigates what variables are correlated with each of \\(b_i\\), \\(a_i\\), and \\(\\zeta_i\\).\nOne problem of this analysis is that, as pointed out in the paper, the interpretation of \\(b_i\\) and \\(a_i\\) is not clear when the full risk-sharing hypothesis is rejected. As Ligon (2008) argues, given that the full risk sharing hypothesis is rejected, the theory does not provide an interpretation that the equation above is a consumption function. In this sense, interpreting the estimates of \\(b_i\\) and \\(a_i\\) as something reflecting time and risk preferences can be misleading, and more complete model needs to explain why full risk-sharing fails while taking into account preference heterogeneity. (Laczo2015?) can be seen as a work attempting this, using dynamic limited commitment as the factor preventing full risk-sharing.\n\n\n3.0.2 Schulhofer-Wohl (2011)\nIn this paper, he shows that ignoring heterogeneous preferences can bias the test of full-risk sharing and the bias is likely to be upward (ie. more likely to reject the full risk-sharing hypothesis) if risk preference is positively correlated with aggregate income shocks. This positive correlation could be seen if more risk-tolerant workers work in more risky sectors, for example. One interesting contribution in his paper is that he gives an interpretation to the coefficient on household income in the Townsend-type regression by considering costly transfers.\nConsider the model in Kurosaki (2001), but for simplicity, just with heterogeneous risk preferences. Also, as in Schulhofer-Wohl (2011), assume that the utility function takes the CRRA form: \\(u_i(c_{it}) = \\frac{c_{it}^{1 - \\gamma_i}}{1 - \\gamma_i}\\).\nThen, letting the Pareto weight be \\(\\alpha_i\\) and the Lagrange multiplier on the aggregate resource constraint divided by the probability of the state being realized be \\(\\rho^t \\lambda_t\\), the first-order condition for consumption is\n\\[\n  \\alpha_i \\left(c_{it}^{*}\\right)^{ - \\gamma_i} = \\lambda_t,\n\\]\nand thus the correct relationship between the consumption and aggregate income is\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it}^* = \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t).\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it}^* = \\frac{\\log \\alpha}{\\gamma} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (- \\log \\lambda_t) + u_{it},\n\\] where \\(u_{it} = \\left(\\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} - \\frac{\\log \\alpha}{\\gamma} \\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\right) (- \\log \\lambda_t)\\). Notice that the first part in \\(u_{it}\\) is removed by using the household fixed effect in the regression, but the second term does not go away. Then, assuming a iid multiplicative error in consumption (\\(\\epsilon_{it}\\)), we obtain\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it} = \\frac{\\log \\alpha}{\\gamma} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (- \\log \\lambda_t) + \\left(\\epsilon_{it} + u_{it} \\right)\n\\] and by including household income for the test of full risk sharing, we obtain the standard regression equation under the assumption of homogeneous risk preferences:\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it} = \\frac{\\log \\alpha}{\\gamma} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (- \\log \\lambda_t) + g \\log X_{it} + \\left(\\epsilon_{it} + u_{it} \\right)\n\\]\nHe shows that \\(Cov(\\log X_{it}, u_{it}) > 0\\) if income responds more strongly to aggregate shocks for less risk-averse households, which results in the upward bias of the estimate of \\(g\\). Using the Health and Retirement Survey, he shows that this is likely to be the case. This implies that ignoring heterogeneous preferences can result in overrejection of the full risk-sharing hypothesis.\nTo run the regression with heterogeneous preferences taken into account, Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) first obtains \\(\\lambda_t\\) by two different methods (the factor or GMM approaches), but as Kurosaki (2001) does, the regression equation can be rewritten in the form without \\(\\lambda_t\\). From \\(\\log c_{it}^* = \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t)\\), we obtain\n\\[\n  \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\log c_{jt}^* = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{\\log \\alpha_j}{\\gamma_j} + (- \\log \\lambda_t) \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{1}{\\gamma_j} \\\\\n  \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t) = \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\log c_{jt}^* - \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{\\log \\alpha_j}{\\gamma_j},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\eta_i = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{1}{\\gamma_j} \\right)^{-1}\\). Using this, \\(\\log c_{it}^* = \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t)\\) can be written as\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it}^* = \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\log c_{jt}^* + \\left( \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} - \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{\\log \\alpha_j}{\\gamma_j} \\right).\n\\] Notice that the second part is time-invariant and controlled by household fixed effects. Therefore, with an error term and household income, the regression equation with heterogeneous preferences becomes\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it} = \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\log c_{it} + g \\log X_{it} + \\left( \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} - \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} \\right) + \\left( \\epsilon_{it} - \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\epsilon_{jt} \\right).\n\\]\nAssuming that \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\epsilon_{jt}\\) is constant across time, the last term is removed by including household fixed effects. Therefore, the coefficients \\(\\eta_i\\) and \\(g\\) can be estimated without deriving \\(\\lambda_t\\).\nAlso, this paper considers transaction cost to explain imperfect risk-sharing and to give an interpretation to the coefficient and household income. In particular, he assumes that the resource is destroyed if household consumption and income differ, and the cost if specified to be \\(\\phi_i \\frac{c}{2} \\left( \\log \\frac{c}{X} \\right)^2\\). With this cost function and an assumption that \\(\\phi_i / (\\phi_i + \\gamma_i) = g \\ \\forall i\\), the author derives\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it} = \\frac{(1 - g) \\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} + \\frac{1 - g}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t) + g \\log X_{it} + \\epsilon_{it}.\n\\] Hence, given that the full risk-sharing hypothesis is rejected, the running a regression with heterogeneous preferences is equivalent to estimating this equation. Using PSID data, he shows that accounting for heterogeneous risk and time preferences decreases the estimate of \\(g\\), which is consistent with his argument that ignoring heterogeneous preferences results in overrejction of the full risk-sharing hypothesis. He also finds that estimates based on homogenenous preferences and on heterogeneous preferences are statistically significantly different. He also finds that the models with homogeneous preferences and with heterogeneous preferences, where the former is nested in the latter, give statistically significantly different estimates. This means the rejection of the hypothesis that the preferences are common across households.\n\n\n3.0.3 Mazzocco and Saini (2012)\nThis paper (i) proposes a test of homogeneous preferences under full insurance, and (ii) proposes a test to evaluate efficiency of risk sharing under heterogeneous preferences. Here only risk preferences are considered due to the relatively small data, although the authors state that it is easy to incorporate time-preference heterogeneity in the model and the tests.\n\n\n3.0.4 Chiappori et al.
