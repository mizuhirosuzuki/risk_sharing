The seminal paper in this literature is Townsend (1994), and I introduce studies before and after this paper and try to relate each other. Fafchamps (2011) reviews this literature extensively, and Ligon (2008) provides a brief (and super awesome!) review of this literature.\nI made this website primarily for my self-learning, but I hope somebody finds the information here interesting.

    "text": "4.1 Kimball (1988)\nIn this paper, he provides a framework for risk-sharing with limited commitment and conducts numerical analyses to see (i) under what parameter values enforceability constraints are satisfied (and hence some form of transfers happens), and (ii) under what parameter values full risk-sharing is achieved. Interestingly, in his formulation of the problem, he does not use the repeated game but instead uses the dynamic optimization, which looks closer to the dynamic limited commitment model (introduced below) in which transfers can depend on past states. However, Kimball explicitly rules out the possibility of consumption depending on the past states (p.226), which makes the framework a static limited commitment model.\nThe paper says Table 1 shows that the enforceability constraints tend to be satisfied with reasonable parameters and Table 3 shows that full risk-sharing can be achieved with reasonable parameters. I am not sure (i) what the expression for \\(W(P)\\) on p.226 is, (ii) how to derive (6), and (iii) how to get numbers on Table 3.\nThe main motivation in this paper is to explain why farmers had scattered plots in Medieval England. Some say this is for insurance (as a form of income diversification), but Kimball argues that this is unlikely since, as shown in the paper, risk-sharing among farmers as informal insurance can be sustained. Thus, he argues that, rather than relying on the costly income diversification (eg. travel time), farmers should use risk-sharing for insurance."

    "text": "4.2 Coate and Ravallion (1993)\nLike Kimball (1988), this paper also considers a risk-sharing model with limited commitment model. Unlike Kimball (1988), however, their framework is based on an infinite-period repeated game: in each period, players either follow a transfer schedule or renege and will stay in autarky forever. Under symmetric income distribution, they compare first-best transfers under full risk-sharing and best implementable transfers (best in the sense that the transfers that maximize the expected utilities).\nThe problem considered in the paper is to maximize the average expected utility of a household (by symmetry, a transfer schedule that maximizes the average expected utility of one household maximizes that of the other household), subject to the following implementability constraints:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  u(y_i) - u(y_i - \\theta_{ij}) &\\le (v^A(\\Theta) - \\overline{v}) / r \\quad \\text{for all } (i, j) \\\\\n  u(y_j) - u(y_j + \\theta_{ij}) &\\le (v^B(\\Theta) - \\overline{v}) / r \\quad \\text{for all } (i, j),\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is income, \\(\\theta_{ij}\\) is the transfer from A to B when the state is \\((i, j)\\), \\(\\Theta\\) is the entire transfer schedule, or informal insurance arrangement, \\(\\overline{v}\\) is the value under autarky, and \\(r\\) is the discount rate. Using this framework, they examine (i) how the best implementable (ie. under the implementability constraints) insurance arrangement and the full risk-sharing insurance arrangement differ, and (ii) how the best implementable insurance arrangement changes with exogenous variables of the model (discount rate and correlation in income realizations). Also, they conduct numerical exercises to show how changes in exogenous variables affect the insurance arrangement. The numerical exercises\nAs suggestions for future research (I mean, “future” from their perspective), they provide three possible directions to extend their model:\n\nto allow non-stationary insurance arrangements, which can depend on both current and past income realizations;\nto allow households to save;\nto allow households’ income to depend on its work effort which others in the community cannot observe.\n\nInterestingly, all of these three extensions have been achieved by later works: (1) by, for example, Ligon, Thomas, and Worrall (2002), (2) by, for example, Ligon, Thomas, and Worrall (2000), and (3) by, for example, XXX."

    "text": "I first review the canonical risk-sharing, which does not have any “friction” which will be introduced in the literature to explain the data more accurately. The main implication of the model is that, given an aggregate resource, a household’s consumption does not depend on its income shock. In other words, households’ consumption only depends on aggregate shocks, not idiosyncratic shocks. For this, the model is called “perfect risk-sharing model” or “full risk-sharing model”. In this part, the model is developed and this implication is derived, and I demonstrate how the model implication has been used in empirical studies in the literature."

It should be noted that CES is an overlapping panel data of 1-year duration with a quarterly sampling frequency, which makes Townsend-like regressions possible. Here, the whole economy is considered as one “village”, implying that risk is presumably shared within the economy. She finds that, while the economy almost achieves full risk-sharing under the CARA utility function, the full risk-sharing hypothesis is rejected under the CRRA utility function for many goods.\nWhile she runs regressions with the same specifications as in Townsend (1994), there are a couple of differences from the study. First, she runs regressions for, in addition to total consumption, different expenditure categories separately (services, nondurables, durables, food, housing, utilities, household furnishings, clothing, medical care, transportation, and recreation). Under full risk-sharing, given that aggregate consumption is controlled for, idiosyncratic shocks should not affect each component of expenditures. Secondly, she uses not only income shocks but also employment shocks and sees if they also affect individual consumption. Again, under full risk-sharing, controlling for aggregate consumption, these non-income shocks should not affect individual consumption as well. Also, in the appendix, she argues that the econometric specification in the paper is valid in the case with multiple goods under general homothetic utility function and with durable goods, although the latter holds under the assumption that the initial endowment of durable goods is identical to the distribution of Pareto weights."

This can cause a spurious correlation between individual consumption and individual income, which can result in rejecting the full risk-sharing hypothesis.

    "text": "A.3 Altonji, Hayashi, and Kotlikoff (1992)\nAlthough their framework does not exactly correspond to the full risk-sharing model, their empirical analysis is pretty close to other studies that test full risk-sharing hypothesis. In particular, they analyze if household consumption is correlated with household income, controlling for the aggregate resources of the extended family linked through altruism (for this control, they use extended-family fixed effects). As mentioned in the paper, their dynamic tests (regressions with first-differences of variables) are equivalent to the test of full risk-sharing. Their alternative hypothesis is the life-cycle model in which household consumption is determined by household income and resources of other households in the same extended family do not matter.\nThey use Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) in the U.S. for 1976-1985. PSID surveyed over 5000 households in 1968 and reinterviewed the heads and spouses of these sample each year since 1968. Importantly, when some household members form new households (eg. marriage of children), these new households are interviewed as well. Connecting these child-households and original parent-households allows them to create a dataset of extended families with variables of each household. They find that the altruism hypothesis is strongly rejected (household income affects household consumption), and the life-cycle model tends to be empirically supported (household consumption is little affected by resources of other households in the same extended family).\nOne thing that can be minor but interesting to me in the analyses is that they consider the possibility of labor supply (or leisure) being a choice variable. Given that leisure is in the utility functions and wage rates are different across households, labor income may be positively correlated with, for example, food consumption since “higher wage rates -> more labor supply -> more food consumption (to compensate less leisure)”. To deal with this, they also use lagged wage in the analyses, and still the altruism hypothesis is strongly rejected (ie. lagged wage affects household consumption).\nOne motivation of this paper is to show that Barro’s neutrality may not hold: that is, redistribution among members of an altruistically linked economic unit can change the unit’s behaviors. In the context of risk sharing in developing countries, this corresponds to the statement that redistribution among members in the same network can change their economic activities. But this may be less relevant in the context of developing countries since policy interventions usually change aggregate resources of the communities and pure redistribution policies are rare."

With this, they derive that\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n  \\theta_{ij}^* = \\min \\{\\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, f(y_i, (v(\\theta^*) - \\overline{v}) / r) \\}.\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nHere, \\(\\theta^*\\) is the contract which results in the highest average expected utility subject to the implementability constraints, and \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is the transfer schedule under the full risk-sharing. Intuitively, this means that, as long as the implementability constraints are not violated, the transfer schedule coincides with the one under full risk-sharing, but otherwise, as much money as possible is transferred so that the constraints are not violated.\nFurthermore, they examine (i) how the best implementable (ie. under the implementability constraints) insurance arrangement and the full risk-sharing insurance arrangement differ, and (ii) how the best implementable insurance arrangement changes with exogenous variables of the model (discount rate and correlation in income realizations). To (i), they find, for example, that the transfers under the implementability constraints do depend on not the level of incomes, unlike the first-best contracts where transfers depend only on the income difference between households. Regarding the comparative static properties as in the question (ii), they demonstrate smaller transfers among less patient househodls and also in situations where income realizations are highly correlated."

A constant relative risk aversion utility function is assumed: \\(u_y = y^{(1 - \\rho)} / (1 - \\rho)\\). Using the representation of the transfer schedule under the constraints, the authors derive the transfer schedule in the following iterative method:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n  \\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{\\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, f(y_i, (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\overline{v}) / r) \\},\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta^*(t)\\) is the vector of transfers obtained at the \\(t\\)th iteration with \\(\\theta^*(0) = 0\\). The converged vector of \\(\\theta^*(t)\\) is used as the implementable transfers.\nThere is one very minor typo in the paper: the equation (5) should be \\(\\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{ \\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, y_i - [y_i^{1 - \\rho} - (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\bar{v}) (1 - \\rho) / r ]^{1 / (1 - \\rho)} \\}\\) instead of \\(\\theta_{ij}^*(t + 1) = \\min \\{ \\widehat{\\theta}_{ij}, y_i - [y_i^{1 - \\rho} - (v(\\theta^*(t)) - \\bar{v}) / r ]^{1 / (1 - \\rho)} \\}\\).

    "text": "2.2 Structural estimation of parameters\nThe other main way to use the full risk-sharing model empirically is to estimate the structural parameters. Usually the parameters themselves are not the main objects of interest, but rather the models are structurally estimated to compare the model fit with other models. For example, Ligon, Thomas, and Worrall (2002) estimate the model with the non-linear squared error method, and Laczó (2015) estimates the full risk-sharing model with the simulated maximum likelihood method. Both of them use the objective values from the estimation to see how much the model explains the data compared to other models such as the limited commitment model.\nHere, I follow the framework in Laczó (2015) to demonstrate how the likelihood function is derived.\n\n2.2.1 Introducing measurement errors\nFirst, I introduce to the full risk-sharing model the measurement error in consumption, which is assumed to be multiplicative and log-normally distributed. In particular, I denote observed consumption, \\(c_{it}^*\\) as \\(c_{it}^* = c_{it} \\exp(\\varepsilon_{it}^c)\\), where \\(\\varepsilon_{it} \\sim N(0, \\gamma_c^2)\\) is the measurement error which is i.i.d. across households and time. With this, the observed village-average consumption, \\(c_{vt}^*\\) is so that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\log(c_{vt}^*)\n  &= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\log(c_{it}^*) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\log(c_{it}) + \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\varepsilon_{it}^c \\\\\n  &= \\log(c_{vt}) + \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\varepsilon_{it}^c \\\\\n  &= \\log(c_{vt}) + \\varepsilon_{vt}^c,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where the village consumption measurement error is defined as \\(\\varepsilon_{vt}^c \\equiv \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\varepsilon_{it}^c\\). Substituting these into \\(\\log(c_{it}) - \\log(c_{i, t - 1}) = \\log(c_{vt}) - \\log(c_{v, t - 1})\\), I obtain \\[\n  \\log(c_{it}^*) - \\log(c_{i, t - 1}^*) = \\log(c_{vt}^*) - \\log(c_{v, t - 1}^*) + \\left(\\varepsilon_{it}^c - \\varepsilon_{vt}^c - (\\varepsilon_{i, t - 1}^c - \\varepsilon_{v, t - 1}^c) \\right).\n\\]\n\n\n2.2.2 Likelihood function\nSince \\(\\varepsilon_{it} \\sim N(0, \\gamma_C^2)\\), I get \\(\\varepsilon_{vt} \\sim N(0, \\frac{\\gamma_C^2}{N})\\), and note that \\(Cov(\\varepsilon_{it}, \\varepsilon_{vt}) = \\frac{\\gamma_C^2}{N}\\). With the independence across periods and households of measurement errors, I obtain \\[\n  Var(\\varepsilon_{it}^c - \\varepsilon_{vt}^c - (\\varepsilon_{i, t - 1}^c - \\varepsilon_{v, t - 1}^c) )\n  = 2\\left(\\gamma_C^2 + \\frac{\\gamma_C^2}{N} - 2\\frac{\\gamma_C^2}{N} \\right)\n  = 2 \\gamma_C^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{N} \\right).\n\\]\nTherefore, the likelihood function is\n\\[\n  L(\\theta) = \\prod_{i} \\prod_{t = 2}^{T} f \\left( \\log \\left( \\frac{c_{it}^*}{c_{i, t - 1}^*} \\right) - \\log \\left( \\frac{c_{vt}^*}{c_{v, t - 1}^*} \\right), \\theta \\right) ,\n\\] and the log likelihood function is \\[\n  l(\\theta) = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{t = 2}^{T} \\log \\left(f \\left( \\log \\left( \\frac{c_{it}^*}{c_{i, t - 1}^*} \\right) - \\log \\left( \\frac{c_{vt}^*}{c_{v, t - 1}^*} \\right), \\theta\\right) \\right),\n\\] where \\(f(x, \\theta)\\) is the density function of \\(x \\sim N \\left(0, \\sqrt{ 2 \\gamma_C^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{N} \\right)} \\right)\\), and \\(\\theta\\) is a parameter to estimate (here, \\(\\theta = \\gamma_C\\)). In estimation, I find the parameter to maximize \\(l(\\theta)\\).\nWithout assuming that the model is correctly specified but assuming that there is no autocorrelation, the standard error of the parameter is \\(A(\\widehat{\\theta})^{-1} B(\\widehat{\\theta}) A(\\widehat{\\theta})^{-1}\\), where \\(A(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) is the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function and \\(B(\\widehat{\\theta})\\) is the outer product of scores (= gradient of log likelihood)."

    "section": "3.1 Kurosaki (2001)",
    "text": "3.1 Kurosaki (2001)\nTo investigate how risk and time preferences affect the test of full risk-sharing as in Townsend (1994), he considers a model with a household-specific time discount factor (\\(\\rho_i\\)) and utility function in which risk preferences can differ (\\(u_i(c_{ist})\\)). Assuming an interior solution, as in Townsend (1994), the Pareto optimal allocation requires\n\\[\n  \\lambda_i \\rho_i^t u_i'(c_{ist}) = \\mu_{st} \\quad \\forall (s,t),\n\\] where \\(\\lambda_{i}\\) is a Pareto weight for household \\(i\\) and \\(\\mu_{st}\\) is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the feasibility constraint, devided by the probability that the state \\(s\\) is realized in time \\(t\\). Assuming a CARA preferences with a household-specific coefficient of absolute risk aversion, \\(A_i\\), we can derive an equation that looks similar to the one in a canonical risk-sharing model:\n\\[\n  c_{it} = \\alpha_i \\overline{c}_t + \\beta_i + \\gamma_i t,\n\\] where\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\alpha_i &= \\frac{1}{A_i} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{1}{A_j} \\right]^{-1} \\\\\n  \\beta_i  &= \\frac{1}{A_i} \\left[ \\ln \\lambda_i - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\alpha_j \\ln \\lambda_j \\right]^{-1} \\\\\n  \\gamma_i &= \\frac{1}{A_i} \\left[ \\ln \\rho_i - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\alpha_j \\ln \\rho_j \\right]^{-1},\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of households in the community.\nThis equation implies that\n\n\\(\\alpha_i\\) is smaller for a more risk averse household, and\n\\(\\gamma_i\\) is more negative (ie. consumption decreases over time) for a more myopic household.\n\nNote that, if there is no heterogeneity, \\(\\alpha_i\\) is common for all households and \\(\\gamma_i = 0 \\quad \\forall i\\). A CRRA utility function results in a similar equation, but with log consumption.\nTo test whether (i) full risk sharing is achieved and (ii) there is any heterogeneity in terms of time and risk preferrences, with CARA utility functinos, the author estimate\n\\[\n  \\Delta c_{it} = b_i + a_i \\Delta \\overline{c}_t + \\zeta_i X_{it} + u_{it},\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_{it}\\) is the first-different household income. While this looks similar to the estimation equation in Townsend (1994), this equation is much more flexible due to household-specific intercepts and slopes. Notice that here the effect of household income (\\(\\zeta_i\\)) is household specific as well, which allows the author to see which households are more “vulnerable” in the sense that income and consumption are more correlated. The estimation results suggest that (i) the full risk-sharing is not achieved, and (ii) there is heterogeneity among households in their sensitivity to aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. The author also investigates what variables are correlated with each of \\(b_i\\), \\(a_i\\), and \\(\\zeta_i\\).\nOne problem of this analysis is that, as pointed out in the paper, the interpretation of \\(b_i\\) and \\(a_i\\) is not clear when the full risk-sharing hypothesis is rejected. As Ligon (2008) argues, given that the full risk sharing hypothesis is rejected, the theory does not provide an interpretation that the equation above is a consumption function. In this sense, interpreting the estimates of \\(b_i\\) and \\(a_i\\) as something reflecting time and risk preferences can be misleading, and more complete model needs to explain why full risk-sharing fails while taking into account preference heterogeneity. Laczó (2015) can be seen as a work attempting this, using dynamic limited commitment as the factor preventing full risk-sharing."

    "text": "3.2 Schulhofer-Wohl (2011)\nIn this paper, he shows that ignoring heterogeneous preferences can bias the test of full-risk sharing and the bias is likely to be upward (ie. more likely to reject the full risk-sharing hypothesis) if risk preference is positively correlated with aggregate income shocks. This positive correlation could be seen if more risk-tolerant workers work in more risky sectors, for example. One interesting contribution in his paper is that he gives an interpretation to the coefficient on household income in the Townsend-type regression by considering costly transfers.\nConsider the model in Kurosaki (2001), but for simplicity, just with heterogeneous risk preferences. Also, as in Schulhofer-Wohl (2011), assume that the utility function takes the CRRA form: \\(u_i(c_{it}) = \\frac{c_{it}^{1 - \\gamma_i}}{1 - \\gamma_i}\\).\nThen, letting the Pareto weight be \\(\\alpha_i\\) and the Lagrange multiplier on the aggregate resource constraint divided by the probability of the state being realized be \\(\\rho^t \\lambda_t\\), the first-order condition for consumption is\n\\[\n  \\alpha_i \\left(c_{it}^{*}\\right)^{ - \\gamma_i} = \\lambda_t,\n\\]\nand thus the correct relationship between the consumption and aggregate income is\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it}^* = \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t).\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it}^* = \\frac{\\log \\alpha}{\\gamma} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (- \\log \\lambda_t) + u_{it},\n\\] where \\(u_{it} = \\left(\\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} - \\frac{\\log \\alpha}{\\gamma} \\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\right) (- \\log \\lambda_t)\\). Notice that the first part in \\(u_{it}\\) is removed by using the household fixed effect in the regression, but the second term does not go away. Then, assuming a iid multiplicative error in consumption (\\(\\epsilon_{it}\\)), we obtain\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it} = \\frac{\\log \\alpha}{\\gamma} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (- \\log \\lambda_t) + \\left(\\epsilon_{it} + u_{it} \\right)\n\\] and by including household income for the test of full risk sharing, we obtain the standard regression equation under the assumption of homogeneous risk preferences:\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it} = \\frac{\\log \\alpha}{\\gamma} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (- \\log \\lambda_t) + g \\log X_{it} + \\left(\\epsilon_{it} + u_{it} \\right)\n\\]\nHe shows that \\(Cov(\\log X_{it}, u_{it}) > 0\\) if income responds more strongly to aggregate shocks for less risk-averse households, which results in the upward bias of the estimate of \\(g\\). Using the Health and Retirement Survey, he shows that this is likely to be the case. This implies that ignoring heterogeneous preferences can result in overrejection of the full risk-sharing hypothesis.\nTo run the regression with heterogeneous preferences taken into account, Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) first obtains \\(\\lambda_t\\) by two different methods (the factor or GMM approaches), but as Kurosaki (2001) does, the regression equation can be rewritten in the form without \\(\\lambda_t\\). From \\(\\log c_{it}^* = \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t)\\), we obtain\n\\[\n  \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\log c_{jt}^* = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{\\log \\alpha_j}{\\gamma_j} + (- \\log \\lambda_t) \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{1}{\\gamma_j} \\\\\n  \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t) = \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\log c_{jt}^* - \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{\\log \\alpha_j}{\\gamma_j},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\eta_i = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{1}{\\gamma_j} \\right)^{-1}\\). Using this, \\(\\log c_{it}^* = \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t)\\) can be written as\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it}^* = \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\log c_{jt}^* + \\left( \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} - \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\frac{\\log \\alpha_j}{\\gamma_j} \\right).\n\\] Notice that the second part is time-invariant and controlled by household fixed effects. Therefore, with an error term and household income, the regression equation with heterogeneous preferences becomes\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it} = \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\log c_{it} + g \\log X_{it} + \\left( \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} - \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\frac{\\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} \\right) + \\left( \\epsilon_{it} - \\eta_i \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\epsilon_{jt} \\right).\n\\]\nAssuming that \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_j \\epsilon_{jt}\\) is constant across time, the last term is removed by including household fixed effects. Therefore, the coefficients \\(\\eta_i\\) and \\(g\\) can be estimated without deriving \\(\\lambda_t\\).\nAlso, this paper considers transaction cost to explain imperfect risk-sharing and to give an interpretation to the coefficient and household income. In particular, he assumes that the resource is destroyed if household consumption and income differ, and the cost if specified to be \\(\\phi_i \\frac{c}{2} \\left( \\log \\frac{c}{X} \\right)^2\\). With this cost function and an assumption that \\(\\phi_i / (\\phi_i + \\gamma_i) = g \\ \\forall i\\), the author derives\n\\[\n  \\log c_{it} = \\frac{(1 - g) \\log \\alpha_i}{\\gamma_i} + \\frac{1 - g}{\\gamma_i} (- \\log \\lambda_t) + g \\log X_{it} + \\epsilon_{it}.\n\\] Hence, given that the full risk-sharing hypothesis is rejected, running a regression with heterogeneous preferences is equivalent to estimating this equation. Using PSID data, he shows that accounting for heterogeneous risk and time preferences decreases the estimate of \\(g\\), which is consistent with his argument that ignoring heterogeneous preferences results in overrejction of the full risk-sharing hypothesis. He also finds that estimates based on homogenenous preferences and on heterogeneous preferences are statistically significantly different. He also finds that the models with homogeneous preferences and with heterogeneous preferences, where the former is nested in the latter, give statistically significantly different estimates. This means the rejection of the hypothesis that the preferences are common across households."
