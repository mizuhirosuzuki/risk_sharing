# Preface {.unnumbered}

This website shows the theories and empirics of risk-sharing models.

Here, by risk-sharing, I consider studies trying to understand the relationships between consumption and income and mechanisms to reduce the correlation through sharing income risks with others.
The seminal paper in this literature is @Townsend1994, and I introduce studies before and after this paper and try to relate each other.
@Fafchamps2011 reviews this literature extensively, and @Ligon2016 provides a brief (and super awesome!) review of this literature.

I made this website primarily for my self-learning, but I hope somebody finds the information here interesting.
Any errors are my own, and please report misinformation or wrong statement if you find any.
